					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>"The Red Caps current data collection process is handwritten notes on a scratch pad, along with data entry on log sheets in the office at the end of each shift. Since all data is on paper, it limits the opportunity for the information to be shared with our community and evaluated by stakeholders. A more efficient data collection process would enable the Red Caps to spend more time out and about in the Downtown District. It would also provide more data to drive decisions by policy makers."</p>

					<h2>Problem</h2>
					<p>The Red Caps provide value to the community from 6th to 11th and from Lincoln to Pearl Street. Their current data collection process is handwritten notes on a scratch pad, along with data entry on log sheets in the office at the end of each shift. Since all data is on paper, it limits the opportunity for the information to be shared with our community and evaluated by stakeholders. A more efficient data collection process would enable the Red Caps to spend more time out and about in the Downtown District. It would also provide more data to drive decisions by policy makers.</p>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Give some love to the Red Caps by way of technology that can enable easy and efficient collection of data through a mobile interface.The data collected: way-finding, meet and greets, escorting employees to their vehicles after dark, responding to emergency calls, reports of vandalism, locking and unlocking buildings for property and business owners and security checks. Then enable a reporting interface or data export mechanism so that the data can be used for the benefit of our community, to identify trends, and to also shine a light on the hard work of the Red Caps.</p>

					<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
					<p class="fragment grow">We wanted to be able to just hand over they keys at the end of the day, so we needed to set up an AWS account just for the Red Caps. That also meant having an email address with which to register and use for the past 40-something hours. Then AWS, despite the fact that our offering will run in the free tier, required a credit card. Again, wanting to be able to just turn everything over, we put a Visa gift card on the account.</p>
					<p class="fragment">While the team built a system that is easily portable, being built on the back of Wordpress, we still wanted to offer a robust system. We have therefore built the system on Amazon Web Services - this is a cloud native solution.</p>
					<p class="fragment grow">We're turning over the following assets to the Red Caps:<p>​
						<li class="fragment">- The i.heart.red.caps@gmail.com email address</li>
						<li class="fragment">- An AWS account registered under that email address</li>
						<li class="fragment">- A $20 gift card</li>
					<p class="fragment grow">This setup should run without further cost for at least a year. At which point it should cost approximately $10/month, but could be reduced to $50/year with the pre-purchase of resources.</p>
